### 0.17.0

This release contains several changes that are not backward compatible.

* requires ruby >= 2.0
* the backdoor API has become more flexible, but some users will find
  existing backdoors no longer work or behave in unexpected ways
* RESET_APP_BETWEEN_SCENARIOS no longer resets the simulator, it only
  resets the app sandbox.  The reset_app_sandbox method has been
  deprecated; it is now a no op. See #878 for details.

This release adds user tracking.
