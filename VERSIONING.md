## Versioning

Calabash tries very hard to comply with Semantic Versioning [1] rules.

However, the semantic versioning spec is incompatible with RubyGem's patterns for pre-release gems.

> "But returning to the practical: No release version of SemVer is compatible with Rubygems." - _David Kellum_ [2]

Calabash version numbers will be in this form:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>[.pre<N>]
```
