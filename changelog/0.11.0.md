## 0.11.0 Change log

This is a bug-fix release targeting primarily Xcode 6, iOS 8 and the iPhone 6 devices. It adds no new features.

### Breaking Change

In certain situations, selectors that return boolean values can return a different Objective-C primitive type.  For example, UISwitch isOn will return a different type on iOS 7 than on iOS 8.

```
query("view marked:'first page' UISwitch marked:'on-off'").first
=> '1'  # iOS 7
=> true # iOS 8
```

In this release, we have decided that the server will return 0 and 1 for boolean values.  This will break tests like this:

```
query("view marked:'first page' UISwitch marked:'on-off'").first == '1'
```

### Fixes

- iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+ Full support. https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/506

- Fix running device with `DEVICE_TARGET=device` https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/534
-  `touch` fails silently in landscape orientation in xcode 6: https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/528

- Support for serialization of new type encodings introduced in iOS8 (ome queries return nil when they shouldn't) https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/529

- Json representation should contain more information about the view https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/344


#### Other

- Serialization of UIColor object now returns a dictionary/hash. *Note* this is potentially breaking for script relying on parsing the `description` of the UIColor object. 

    {
          "red" => 0,
        "alpha" => 0.3,
         "blue" => 0,
        "green" => 0
    }

- Do a documentation level deprecation of Calabash::Cucumber::Version.
