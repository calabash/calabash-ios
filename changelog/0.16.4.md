### 0.16.4

This release requires a server update to 0.16.4

* [Updating your Calabash iOS version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/B1-Updating-your-Calabash-iOS-version)

It also requires a run-loop update to 1.5.5.

* [Updating your run-loop version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Updating-your-run-loop-version)

This is a patch release for the server.  Xcode 7.0.1 introduced

libraries included in this release are compatible with these
new rules.
