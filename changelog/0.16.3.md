### Calabash 2.0

Calabash 2.0 is in pre-release.

Please report issues with Calabash 2.0 as a GitHub issue or on Stack Overflow.

We are looking for help from the community to finish implementing Calabash 2.0.
You can see what has to be done in the project [GitHub issues](https://github.com/calabash/calabash/issues).

**Xamarin Test Cloud users:** Calabash 2.0 is not yet supported on Test Cloud.
Test Cloud support will be available _before_ Calabash 2.0 is released.

### Features

This release provides support for Xcode 7 and experimental support for 7.1 beta 1.
iOS 9 beta devices are available on the Xamarin Test Cloud.

There are several things that are known not to work in Xcode 7.

1. Sending apps to the background is broken on Xcode 7 simulators and iOS 9
   devices.
2. The fast :preferences UIA strategy is broken for Xcode 7 simulators; the
   default strategy will be :host.  The :host strategy is already the
   default for physical devices (since Xcode 6).  If you are looking for a
   faster alternative to :host, you can try the :shared_element strategy
   (for both simulators and devices). Keep in mind that this strategy
   has not been thoroughly tested and may not work on all apps.
3. We have several failing unit tests in the Calabash iOS Server for Xcode 7
   that appear to indicate a problem with Apple's UIView internals when
   translating points in UIWebView and WKWebView.  Our WebView cucumber tests
   are passing, but we want to notify people that there might be a problem.
4. Xcode 7's [simctl uninstall/install API is broken](https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/51922).

### Breaking Changes

The Playback API that Calabash iOS has been using for device rotation since
iOS 4 stopped working on iOS 9.  Device rotations are now done with the
UIAutomation Device Rotation API.  This is a breaking change because on
physical devices, _the app will launch in the last orientation it was forced
into._  Previously, apps would launch in portrait (or in landscape if
the app was landscape only).  Tests that rely on a particular orientation
should assert the orientation before the test starts.  We recommend
`rotate_home_button_to({:up|:down|:left|:right})`.

Calls to `ensure_split_keyboard` and `ensure_undocked_keyboard` in iOS 9
will raise a `KeyboardModeError`.  If a keyboard is already in split or
undocked mode, calling `ensure_docked_keyboard` will raise an error.

### Documentation

This is a reminder to check out the Calabash documentation on the Xamarin
site.  The information there is excellent and constantly improving.
