### Announcements

Please do not install gems with sudo.

If you are just getting started with Ruby and Calabash on MacOS, we have a new
tool: [the calabash-sandbox](https://github.com/calabash/install).

For advanced users, we recommend a [managed ruby](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Ruby-on-MacOS#ruby-managers-on-macos).

If you are not already using bundler and Gemfile, we strongly recommend
that you start.

#### Docs and Examples

For this release, we've updated the README and many of the wiki pages.  At the
moment the wiki is _publicly editiable_.  If you see a typo or a way to improve
the docs, please make the change.  If the change is significant, create an
issue and we can discuss.

We have also updated the following repositories:

* [LPSimpleExample](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-example)
  - Getting starting with Calabash
* [iOS Smoke Test App](https://github.com/calabash/ios-smoke-test-app)
  - nearly 100% coverage of all the Calabash iOS gestures and behaviors
  - examples of how manage the app life cycle and reset the keychain
  - scripts that demonstrate an efficient Calabash workflow, including how to
    stage binaries from Xcode builds and how to submit to the Xamarin Test
    Cloud.
* [iOS WebView App](https://github.com/calabash/ios-webview-test-app)
  - Updated with iframe examples

#### :preferences

In Xcode 7, Apple once again changed/broke the UIAutomation Preferences API.
We've updated the server so the :preferences strategy is available again.
Unfortunately, the :preferences strategy is not stable enough on
physical devices for us to make it the default.

For now, we are keeping the default strategy as :host.  You can opt in to
:preferences by:

```ruby

# Cucumber hook
options = {
  :uia_strategy => :preferences
}

launcher.relaunch(options)

# Console
> start_test_server_in_background({:uia_strategy => :preferences})
```

As we get feedback about :preferences, we'll change the defaults.

Xamarin Test Cloud users:  :preferences is available, but we cannot
recommend it - it is simply not stable enough.

### Calabash 2.0

Calabash 2.0 is in pre-release.

Please report issues with Calabash 2.0 as a GitHub issue or on Stack Overflow.

We are looking for help from the community to finish implementing Calabash 2.0.
You can see what has to be done in the project [GitHub issues](https://github.com/calabash/calabash/issues).

**Xamarin Test Cloud users:** Calabash 2.0 is not yet supported on Test Cloud.
Test Cloud support will be available _before_ Calabash 2.0 is released.
