## 0.9.166 changelog

### fixes

- [issue 256](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/256) - touching number pad delete on iOS 7 iphone family devices

- [issue 284]( https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/284) - backslashes should be properly escaped when launching with Instruments

- Fix issue where `keyboard_enter_text` failed on iPad 4th gen because CalabashScript/UIA generated invalid JSON

### improvements

- added `assert_map_results` to unify how we ensure `Calabash::Cucumber::map` has returned a valid result

- added `server_debug_level` methods to be used to dynamically set server debug levels in the future

### Deprecated

These functions, methods, or cucumber steps have been deprecated and will now generate warning messages.

To suppress deprecated warnings set `ENV['CALABASH_NO_DEPRECATION']=1` (not recommend).

* since 0.9.131 `query_all` - use `query("view all")` - see [Query Syntax](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/05-Query-syntax)
* since 0.9.145 `set_text`  - use `keyboard_enter_text` or (sparingly) `clear_text`
* since 0.9.151 `When I clear "some text field"` - no replacement
* since 0.9.163 `await_keyboard` - use `wait_for_keyboard`
* since 0.9.163 `keyboard_enter_char` second arg `should_screenshot` has been replaced by an options hash. Use the `:should_screenshot` key instead
* since 0.9.163 `send_uia_command`  - use `uia("...javascript..", options)` instead.  This has not been formally deprecated (no warnings will be generated) yet, but it will be in a future version.
