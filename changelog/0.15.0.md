Thank you to everyone who has made comments on the [Calabash 2.0 GitHub issue](https://github.com/calabash/calabash/issues/55).  Keep those comments coming, we are listening.  Calabash 2.0 is in pre-release.  Please report issues with Calabash 2.0 as a GitHub issue or on Stack Overflow.  Progress on Calabash 2.0 has been halted until Xcode 7 support has stabilized.  We are looking for help from the community to finish implementing Calabash 2.0.  You can see what has to be done in the project [GitHub issues](https://github.com/calabash/calabash/issues).

**Xamarin Test Cloud users:** Calabash 2.0 is not yet supported on Test Cloud.  Test Cloud support will be available _before_ Calabash 2.0 is released.

### Features

This release provides experimental support for Xcode 7 beta.  We have had success testing on physical devices, but are seeing problems on Xcode 7's iOS Simulators.

Many thanks to @ashisht99x for **Added rescue block to handle ECONNREFUSED exception** [#814](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/pull/814).  That pull request corrects a problem reported by many users.
