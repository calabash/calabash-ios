### Features

### Changes

#### Lock down dependency on edn

Calabash depends on the 'edn' gem. This project released a bad gem which would cause Calabash to fail unless pry was installed. This release locks down 'edn' to `1.0.3`.

#### Validate and log UIAChannel communication

A stability improvement which logs UIA actions via the UIAChannel in Calabash server. Should be transparent to most users.

### Fixes

### Deprecated

See https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Deprecated

##### NEW

* since 0.10.0 `Calabash::Cucumber::Device.udid` - no replacement
* since 0.10.0 `tap` - replaced with `tap_mark`

### Other

#### rspec testing for testing Calabash iOS gem
