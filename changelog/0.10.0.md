### Features

#### yard

Formally adopting yard as the documentation tool.  See README_YARD.md for details.

#### travis-ci

Now testing with travis-ci.

### Changes

#### Lock down dependency on edn

Calabash depends on the 'edn' gem. This project released a bad gem which would cause Calabash to fail unless pry was installed. This release locks down 'edn' to `1.0.3`.

#### Validate and log UIAChannel communication

A stability improvement which logs UIA actions via the UIAChannel in Calabash server. Should be transparent to most users.

### Fixes

#### Resetting App and Simulator Content & Settings

Fixed a minor bug in `reset_app_jail` and deprecated it.  It has been replaced by `reset_app_sandbox`.

Added `Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.reset_simulator` for simulating touching the iOS Simulator > Reset Simulator Content and Settings... Menu Item.
