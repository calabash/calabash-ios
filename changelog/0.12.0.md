## 0.12.0 changelog

Primarily a bugfix, polish and stability release.

### Features

##### Fast `enter_text` command [#639](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/pull/639)

This skips using the software keyboard and calls `setValue`. This is sometimes desired for speed, 
but has the downside that apps reacting to individual keystrokes (e.g. type ahead) don't respond normally.

- https://github.com/calabash/x-platform-example/blob/master/features/ios/pages/login_page.rb#L23 

##### Generalize indexpath search to collection views. [#607](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/607)[server #99](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-server/pull/99)

This will support queries of form:

`touch("collectionViewCell indexPath:#{row},#{sec}")`

##### Dump views [server #102](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-server/pull/102)

To see a view dump, use: `curl http://localhost:37265/dump`

##### Read Server port from app's Info.plist [server #94](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-server/pull/94)

Thanks @isachs.

### Changes

* Reduce logging and allow `server_debug_level()` to control the debug level on the server.
* Experimental new strategy for communicating with UIAutomation (:shared_element, Shared UIA Element) [#97](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-server/pull/97).  Note that while this works well, there are still some cases where it breaks down, e.g., app deep linking. [#642](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/642)
* Detect architecture of `.app` bundles to prevent "App launches and quits repeatedly". [Hot Topic](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Hot-Topics#1-when-targeting-a-simulator-the-app-launches-then-quits-several-times-in-rapid-succession)


### Fixes

- App hanging when UIAutomation is active and the app logs too much via NSLog. We removed excessive logging in Calabash server, but this can still occur if the app logs itself.
- Missed writes to preferences while automating
- Intermittent 'Could not parse response '';' error... [#600](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/600)
- Intermittent timeouts performing gestures... [#585](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/585)
- Backslash handling in 0.11.5.pre5 is inconsistent... [#640](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/640)
- iOS8 swipe with query fails [#586](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/586)
- Unstable accept of System alerts [#636](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/636)

#### Other

We've discovered a known issue when running on arm64 devices on iOS 7.0.x: reflective extraction of values of type double always return null due to an Apple bug in iOS. For example `query("view", :alpha).first`.
