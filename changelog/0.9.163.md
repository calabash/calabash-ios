### 0.9.163 changelog

Primary reason for this release is to speed up test execution on iOS7 by avoiding dependency on [performTaskWithPathArgumentsTimeout](https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/documentation/UIAutomation/Reference/UIAHostClassReference/UIAHost/UIAHost.html#//apple_ref/javascript/instm/UIAHost/performTaskWithPathArgumentsTimeout) which is well-known to execute only once per second. Although some clever folks at Facebook have been able to patch UIAutomation on the simulator to avoid this delay, we would refrain from using that technique since it is limited to simulator execution. A core principle of calabash is that on-device execution should be supported.

From 0.9.163 UIA commands are sent via the http server which communicates them to the external UIA script via preferences as was previously done with the __calabash preference. This doesn't suffer from the 1 second delay.

There are no significant API level changes and this release should be fully backwards compatible except that tests running under instruments using UIAutomation should run significantly (30-50%) faster depending on the test suite.
