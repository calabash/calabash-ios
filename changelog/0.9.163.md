## 0.9.163 changelog

Primary reason for this release is to speed up test execution on iOS7 by avoiding dependency on [performTaskWithPathArgumentsTimeout](https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/documentation/UIAutomation/Reference/UIAHostClassReference/UIAHost/UIAHost.html#//apple_ref/javascript/instm/UIAHost/performTaskWithPathArgumentsTimeout) which is well-known to execute only once per second. Although some clever folks at Facebook have been able to patch UIAutomation on the simulator to avoid this delay, we would refrain from using that technique since it is limited to simulator execution. A core principle of calabash is that on-device execution should be supported.

From 0.9.163 UIA commands are sent via the http server which communicates them to the external UIA script via preferences as was previously done with the __calabash preference. This doesn't suffer from the 1 second delay.

There are no significant API level changes and this release should be fully backwards compatible except that tests running under instruments using UIAutomation should run significantly (30-50%) faster depending on the test suite.

### Deprecated

These functions, methods, or cucumber steps have been deprecated and will now generate warning messages.

To suppress deprecated warnings set `ENV['CALABASH_NO_DEPRECATION']=1` (not recommend).

* since 0.9.131 `query_all` - use `query("view all")` - see [Query Syntax](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/05-Query-syntax)
* since 0.9.145 `set_text`  - use `keyboard_enter_text` or (sparingly) `clear_text` 
* since 0.9.151 `When I clear "some text field"` - no replacement
* since 0.9.163 `await_keyboard` - use `wait_for_keyboard`
* since 0.9.163 `keyboard_enter_char` second arg `should_screenshot` has been replaced by an options hash. Use the `:should_screenshot` key instead
* since 0.9.163 `send_uia_command`  - use `uia("...javascript..", options)` instead.  This has not been formally deprecated (no warnings will be generated) yet, but it will be in a future version.

### iOS 7 WebViews 

Fix webView issue for some iOS7 webView apps discussed [on the forum.](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/calabash-ios/XqktE7hLT4E/ieK_j8vZHCMJ)

### Privacy Settings

Support for setting the state of Privacy settings (access to photos, contacts, calendar) on the Simulator only
  - fixes #264 https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/264
  - see [https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/blob/0.9.x/calabash-cucumber/lib/calabash-cucumber/launcher.rb#L9](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/blob/0.9.x/calabash-cucumber/lib/calabash-cucumber/launcher.rb#L9)

Add the following to your hooks (features/support/01_launch.rb)
    
```
@calabash_launcher.relaunch(privacy_settings: {photos: {allow: true}})
```

### Improved keyboard interactions on the iPad and email compose views

Thanks to:

* @nkammah, @avanderberg, @jmoody, Riley Marsh, and Raj Udapudi  for reporting
* Niels Frydenholm for reporting and testing
* (pull 258) fixes `keyboard_enter_text` cannot enter all characters on iPad simulator and iPad device
  - thanks @ivanandriollo
  - https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/pull/258


Can now use the iPad keyboard mode key to [dock, undock, and split the keyboard (issue 265).](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/265)  Thanks to @nkammah. 

- `ensure_docked_keyboard`
- `ensure_undocked_keyboard`
- `ensure_split_keyboard`

Resolves skipped keys and capitalization problems.  If you experience problems on iOS < 7 you can control the rate of key board entry using:

- `POST_ENTER_KEYBOARD` time to wait after touching a key - defaults to 0.05 
- `KEYPLANE_SEARCH_STEP_PAUSE` time to wait after changing key planes - defaults to 0.2

Can now detect `MFMailComposeViewController` (email compose) keyboards with:

- `uia_keyboard_visible?`
- `uia_wait_for_keyboard`

Can now dismiss the iPad keyboard:

- `dismiss_ipad_keyboard`

### Analyzed problems with `uia_type_string`

`uia_type_string` raises an exception instead when it detects a error status - [issue 260.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/260)
 
During testing we discovered a bug in Apple's UIAutomation bug that causes characters to be skipped or input with the incorrect case:  https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/269.

Please file bug reports at http://bugreport.apple.com - every report counts.
      
### Detecting the test environment

* `uia_available?` and `uia_not_available?` - was the app launched with Instruments?
* `xamarin_test_cloud?`
* `default_device` returns the `device` (`Calabash::Cucumber::Device`)  attribute of the current `launcher`
* `ipad?, iphone?, simulator?`
* `iphone_5?`, `iphone_4in`
* `ios5?, ios6?, ios7?` - if the `OS` env is set, returns that value.  if not, queries the test device for iOS version
* `iphone_app_emulated_on_ipad?` detecting iPhone apps emulated on the iPad. [Partial fix for #185](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/185).
* `landscape?` and `portrait?` for detecting the orientation of the app

### Other Fixes

* (pull 29) `server_version` now indicates the remote origin of the calabash server git repo
