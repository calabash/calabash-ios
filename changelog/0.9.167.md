## 0.9.167 changelog

**IMPORTANT** requires a server update to 0.9.167

### Features

###### scrolling on UICollectionView

```
# scroll to item 0 in section 2 to top
scroll_to_collection_view_item(0, 2, {:scroll_position => :top})

# scroll to item 5 in section 0 to bottom
scroll_to_collection_view_item(5, 0, {:scroll_position => :bottom})
```

# extend :as feature of advanced queries
* (pull server 30) https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-server/pull/30 - thanks @LiohAu.

Certain types of advanced queries make reflective calls on objects queried. For methods that require arbitrary types we can use the `:as`. For example to call a method that takes an NSIndexPath we can now use the `:as` feature, for example `scrollToRowAtIndexPath:atScrollPosition:animated:`:

```
         query("tableView",
            [{scrollToRowAtIndexPath:[{:indexPathForRow=>20},{:inSection=>0}],  as: "NSIndexPath"},
             {atScrollPosition:0},
             {animated:1}])
```

### Fixes

* (pull 307) Fix brackets in twitter reference
  - thanks @nemesis-fw
* (issue 309) keyboard_enter_char 'Return' no longer touches the keyboard action key when app is launched by Instruments

* Bump run_loop 0.1.4 - adds retries with larger timeout to workaround UIA bug failing to tap a key even if visible.


### Deprecated

These functions, methods, or cucumber steps have been deprecated and will now generate warning messages.

To suppress deprecated warnings set `ENV['CALABASH_NO_DEPRECATION']=1` (not recommend).

* since 0.9.131 `query_all` - use `query("view all")` - see [Query Syntax](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/05-Query-syntax)
* since 0.9.145 `set_text`  - use `keyboard_enter_text` or (sparingly) `clear_text`
* since 0.9.151 `When I clear "some text field"` - no replacement
* since 0.9.163 `await_keyboard` - use `wait_for_keyboard`
* since 0.9.163 `keyboard_enter_char` second arg `should_screenshot` has been replaced by an options hash. Use the `:should_screenshot` key instead
* since 0.9.163 `send_uia_command`  - use `uia("...javascript..", options)` instead.  This has not been formally deprecated (no warnings will be generated) yet, but it will be in a future version.
