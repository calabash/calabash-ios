### 0.19.0

These notes are not complete yet.

### TODO

- [ ] update API docs

This is a significant release. We have dropped many legacy APIs and behaviors
to make space for our new DeviceAgent tool which is our replacement for
UIAutomation.  This release of Calabash does not contain an interface to
DeviceAgent, but if you look at commit history of run_loop, you will see that
have already started integrating DeviceAgent with run_loop.

Requirements:

* Calabash iOS server == 0.19.0
* run_loop >= 2.1.1
* Ruby >= 2.0

These two wiki pages have instructions for updating the most recent versions.

* [Updating your Calabash iOS version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/B1-Updating-your-Calabash-iOS-version)
* [Updating your run-loop version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Updating-your-run-loop-version)

### Sudo

Please do not install gems with sudo.

If you are just getting started with Ruby and Calabash on MacOS, we have a new
tool: [the calabash-sandbox](https://github.com/calabash/install).

For advanced users, we recommend a [managed ruby](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Ruby-on-MacOS#ruby-managers-on-macos).

If you are not already using bundler and Gemfile, we strongly recommend
that you start.

### IMPORTANT

The WebView marked API [1] has been removed; see this issue [2] for more details. 

`done` has been removed [3] from the public API because it conflicts with Cucumber 2.1 `done`.  

`tap` has been removed from the public API.  It has been deprecated since 0.10.0.  Use `touch`.  Thank you for everyone who reported problems and for your patience.

`map` has been replaced with `Calabash::Cucumber::Map.map`. [4]

`Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher` has been rewritten. You will find many methods have been deprecated or removed.  You might need to update your launch hooks.

Calabash no longer responds to these environment variables:

* CALABASH\_NO\_DEPRECATION
* DETECT\_CONNECTED\_DEVICE
* CALABASH\_FULL\_CONSOLE\_LOGGING

These variables are being replaced:

* NO\_STOP is in the process of being deprecated; use QUIT\_APP\_AFTER\_SCENARIO
* BUNDLE\_ID and APP\_BUNDLE\_PATH are in the process of being replaced with APP.

The public documentation [5] describes what variables Calabash iOS responds to.

* [1] [WebView marked API](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/06-WebView-Support#deprecated-apis) 
* [2] Cannot query UIWebView by accessibilityIdentifier or accessibilityLabel
[#735](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/735) @scottgoldwater
* [3] KeyboardHelpers#done clobbers the Cucumber 2.1 method #done [#976](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/976) @TeresaP, @lucatorella
* [4] Change Map module to class and provide class methods [#1065](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/1065) @svandeven
* [5] http://calabashapi.xamarin.com/ios/file.ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.html

### Improvements

The `calabash-ios console` was updated with methods to improve discoverability and your workflow.

Thanks to @ark-konopacki for porting console methods from briar and
Calabash 2.0

```
$ bundle exec calabash-ios console

#########################  Useful Methods  ##########################
     ids => List all the visible accessibility ids.
  labels => List all the visible accessibility labels.
    text => List all the visible texts.
   marks => List all the visible marks.
    tree => The app's visible view hierarchy.
   flash => flash(<query>); Disco effect for views matching <query>
 verbose => Turn debug logging on.
   quiet => Turn debug logging off.
    copy => Copy console commands to clipboard.
   clear => Clear the console.

Calabash says, "Don't touch that button!"
calabash-ios 0.19.0.pre2>
```

The `DEVICE_TARGET` method can take a device name as an argument as long as it appears as the name that appears in the output of `xcrun instruments -s devices`.

```
$ xcrun instruments -s devices
Known Devices:
stern [4AFA58C7-<snip>-04301E70E235]
denis (9.3.1) [19368<snip>d8dd0d]

$ DEVICE_TARGET=denis DEVICE_ENDPOINT=http://denis.local:37265 bundle exec cucumber
```

We are experimenting with the automatic detection of the DEVICE_ENDPOINT.  Pull requests are welcome. [1][2]

### Docs and Examples

For this release, we've updated the README and many of the wiki pages.  At the
moment the wiki is _publicly editiable_.  If you see a typo or a way to improve
the docs, please make the change.  If the change is significant, create an
issue and we can discuss.

We have also updated the following repositories:

* [LPSimpleExample](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-example)
  - Getting starting with Calabash
* [iOS Smoke Test App](https://github.com/calabash/ios-smoke-test-app)
  - nearly 100% coverage of all the Calabash iOS gestures and behaviors
  - examples of how manage the app life cycle and reset the keychain
  - scripts that demonstrate an efficient Calabash workflow, including how to
    stage binaries from Xcode builds and how to submit to the Xamarin Test
    Cloud.
* [iOS WebView App](https://github.com/calabash/ios-webview-test-app)
  - Updated with iframe examples

### :preferences

We've discovered the :preferences is not stable enough to use on Simulators
or physical devices.  The default will remain :host.

### Calabash 2.0

Calabash 2.0 is in pre-release.

Please report issues with Calabash 2.0 as a GitHub issue or on Stack Overflow.

We are looking for help from the community to finish implementing Calabash 2.0.
You can see what has to be done in the project [GitHub issues](https://github.com/calabash/calabash/issues).

**Xamarin Test Cloud users:** Calabash 2.0 is not yet supported on Test Cloud.
Test Cloud support will be available _before_ Calabash 2.0 is released.
