Commands:

  gen
    creates a skeleton features dir. This is usually used once when
    setting up calabash to ensure that the features folder contains
    the right step definitions and environment to run with cucumber.

  console
    starts an interactive console to interact with your app via Calabash.
    Copies the irb_ios5.sh and irb_ios4.sh scripts and the .irbrc file
    then launches irb_ios5.sh.

  setup [<path>]
    (EXPERIMENTAL)
    Automates setting up your iOS Xcode project
    with calabash-ios-server. It is your responsibility to ensure
    that your production build does not link with calabash.framework.
    setup will try to ensure this, but you should check manually.

    setup will download calabash.framework and modify you Xcode project
    file. The parameter [path] is optional (default is the current dir).
    If specified [path] should be the path to your iOS Xcode project
    (i.e., the folder which contains projectname.xcodeproj).

    The following modifications are made
      - duplicate an existing target of your choice
      - add the calabash.framework to your Frameworks folder
      - add $(SRCROOT) to framework search path
      - link with calabash.framework in duped target
      - link with Apple's CFNetwork.framework in duped target
      - setup special linker options to ensure calabash is loaded

    Your Xcode project file will be backed up as project.pbxproj.bak.
    The backup is placed in the .xcodeproj folder for your project.
    If something goes wrong. Close Xcode and copy project.pbxproj.bak
    to project.pbxproj inside your .xcodeproj folder.

  download [<path>]
    downloads latest compatible version of calabash.framework.
    It should be run from a directory containing an Xcode project,
    or optionally opt_path should be supplied and pointing to a
    directory containing an Xcode project.
    Download will download the latest version that matches the
    currently installed calabash-cucumber gem.
    To update Calabash for your project run

      gem update calabash-cucumber
      calabash-ios download

  check [{<path to .ipa>|<path to .app>}]
    (EXPERIMENTAL)
    check whether an app or ipa is linked with calabash.framework
    if called without parameter [.app or .ipa] then pwd should be
    a directory containing an xcodeproj. In this case we'll check
    the default Xcode simulator build path for a Debug and Calabash
    build configurations. We check that Debug doesn't link with
    calabash.framework but Calabash does.

  sim locale <lang> [<region>]
    Changes the regional settings for the iOS Simulators. You must
    ensure the correct format for the optional regional parameter,
    for example, da_DK, en_US.

  sim location {on|off} <bundleid>
    Set allow location on/off for current project or bundleid.

  sim reset
    (EXPERIMENTAL)
    Will select "Reset Content and Settings" in the iOS Simulators
    using AppleScript.

  sim acc
    Enable accessibility in all iOS Simulators

  sim device {iPad|iPad_Retina|iPhone|iPhone_Retina|iPhone_Retina_4inch}
    Will set the default iOS Simulator device.
