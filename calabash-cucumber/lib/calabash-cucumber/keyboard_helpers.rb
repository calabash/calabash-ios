    # Raised when there is a problem involving a keyboard mode.  There are
    # three keyboard modes:  docked, split, and undocked.
    #
    # All iPads support these keyboard modes, but the user can disable them
    # in Settings.app.
    #
    # The iPhone 6+ family also supports keyboard modes, but Calabash does
    # support keyboard modes on these devices.
    class KeyboardModeError < StandardError; ; end

    # Collection of methods for interacting with the keyboard.
    #
    # We've gone to great lengths to provide the fastest keyboard entry possible.
    #
    # If you are having trouble with skipped or are receiving JSON octet
    # errors when typing, you might be able to resolve the problems by slowing
    # down the rate of typing.
    #
    # Example:  Use keyboard_enter_char + :wait_after_char.
    #
    # ```
    # str.each_char do |char|
    #   # defaults to 0.05 seconds
    #   keyboard_enter_char(char, `{wait_after_char:0.5}`)
    # end
    # ```
    #
    # Example:  Use keyboard_enter_char + POST_ENTER_KEYBOARD
    #
    # ```
    # $ POST_ENTER_KEYBOARD=0.1 bundle exec cucumber
    # str.each_char do |char|
    #   # defaults to 0.05 seconds
    #   keyboard_enter_char(char)
    # end
    # ```

    # @note
    #  We have an exhaustive set of keyboard related test.s  The API is reasonably
    #  stable.  We are fighting against known bugs in Apple's UIAutomation. You
    #  should only need to fall back to the examples below in unusual situations.
