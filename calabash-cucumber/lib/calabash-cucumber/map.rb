      # Returns an array of views matched by the `query` or the result of
      # performing the Objective-C sequence defined by the `method_name` and
      # `method_args` on all the views matched by the `query`.
      #
      # This is not a method that users should be calling directly.
      #
      # The `method_name` is typically mapped to an LPOperation on the server.
      # Some examples of LPOperations are:
      #
      #   * :flash
      #   * :scrollToRowWithMark
      #   * :changeDatePickerDate
      #
      # If `method_name` maps to no LPOperation, then it is treated a selector
      # and is performed on any view that matches `query`.
      #
      # @examples
      #
      #   # Calls 'text' on any visible UITextField, because :text is not a defined operation.
      #   > map("textField", :text)
      #   => [ "old text" ]
      #
      #   # Does not call 'setText:', because :setText is a defined operation.
      #   > map("textField", :setText, 'new text')
      #   => [ <UITextField ... > ]
      #
      #   # Calls 'setText:', because 'setText:' is not a defined operation.
      #   > map("textField", 'setText:', 'newer text')
      #   => [ "<VOID>" ]
      #
      #   # Will return [] because :unknownSelector is not defined on UITextField.
      #   > map("textField", :unknownSelector)
      #   => []
      #
      #   # Will return [] because 'setAlpha' requires 1 argument and none was provided.
      #   # An error will be logged by the server in the device logs.
      #   > map("textField", 'setAlpha:')
      #   => []
      #
      #
      # Well behaved LPOperations should return the view as JSON objects.
      #
      # @todo Calabash LPOperations should return 'views touched' in JSON format
