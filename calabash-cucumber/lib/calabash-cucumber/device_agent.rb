    # An interface to the DeviceAgent Query and Gesture API.
    #
    # Unlike Calabash or UIA gestures, all DeviceAgent gestures wait for the
    # uiquery to match a view.  This behavior match the Calabash 2.0 and
    # Calabash 0.x Android behavior.
    #
    # This API is work in progress.  There are several methods that are
    # experimental and several methods that will probably removed soon.
    #
    # Wherever possible use Core#query and the gestures defined in Core.
    #

      #
      #  query({marked: "login", type: "TextField"})
      #

      #  # Escaping single quote is not necessary, but supported.
      #  query({text: "Karl's problem"})
      #  query({text: "Karl\'s problem"})

      #  query({text: "\"To know is not enough.\""})
      #  query({text: %Q["To know is not enough."]})
      #
      # Querying for text with newlines is not supported yet.
      #
      # The query language supports the following keys:
      # * :marked - accessibilityIdentifier, accessibilityLabel, text, and value
      # * :id - accessibilityIdentifier
      # * :type - an XCUIElementType shorthand, e.g. XCUIElementTypeButton =>
      #   Button. See the link below for available types.  Note, however that
      #   some XCUIElementTypes are not available on iOS.
      # * :index - Applied after all other specifiers.
      # * :all - Filter the result by visibility. Defaults to false. See the
      #   discussion below about visibility.
      #
      # ### Visibility
      #
      # The rules for visibility are:
      #
      # 1. If any part of the view is visible, the visible.
      # 2. If the view has alpha 0, it is not visible.
      # 3. If the view has a size (0,0) it is not visible.
      # 4. If the view is not within the bounds of the screen, it is not visible.
      #
      # Visibility is determined using the "hitable" XCUIElement property.
      # XCUITest, particularly under Xcode 7, is not consistent about setting
      # the "hitable" property correctly.  Views that are not "hitable" will
      # still respond to gestures. For this reason, gestures use the
      # element["rect"] for computing the touch point.
      #
      # Regarding rule #1 - this is different from the Calabash iOS and Android
      # definition of visibility which requires the mid-point of the view to be
      # visible.
      #
      # Please report visibility problems.
      #
      # ### Results
      #
      # Results are returned as an Array of Hashes.  The key/value pairs are
      # similar to those returned by the Calabash iOS Server, but not exactly
      # the same.
