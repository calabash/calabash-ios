# The `IBase` class is a base class that can be used to easily implement page object classes on iOS (hence the I).
# Delegates to the cucumber World object for missing methods (e.g. embed or puts).
# Mixes in {Calabash::Cucumber::Operations}.
# For Calabash Android there is a corresponding `ABase`.
# For more detailed documentation on using the Page Object Pattern (POP) with Calabash, please see:
# {http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/calabash/xplat-best-practices/}.
# Note we recommend using POP even if you're not targeting multiple platforms as it tends to lead to more maintainable
# test suites.
