      # Provides methods to interact with the 1x and 2x buttons that appear
      # when an iPhone-only app is emulated on an iPad.  Calabash cannot
      # interact with these apps in 2x mode because the touch coordinates
      # cannot be reliably translated from normal iPhone dimensions to the
      # emulated dimensions.
      #
      # On iOS < 7, an app _remembered_ its last 1x/2x scale so when it
      # reopened the previous scale would be the same as when it closed.  This
      # meant you could manually set the scale once to 1x and never have to
      # interact with the scale button again.
      #
      # On iOS > 7, the default behavior is that all emulated apps open at 2x
      # regardless of their previous scale.
      #
      # @note In order to use this class, you must allow Calabash to launch
      #  your app with instruments.
